            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My passion for creation sprouted while pursuing business when I spent days building props from scratch for events and was fueled further towards product design with the way in which it can thoughtfully and practically improve daily lives. With a foundation in industrial design amongst other disciplines, my fundamental values along with my skill set aim to produce intuitive, functional, and user-centric designs using design thinking principles. Not only do I view design as a solution to problems, but as that solution that further enhances the experience.</p>
            <p>This stemmed from a personal experience I had while trekking a mountain in India. I was truly inspired by the locals who utilized the most basic items in several ways to meet their requirements and made do with whatever little they had. I sat with them and heard stories of their struggles and how they developed their space, despite facing difficulties. Although, they are content with what they have, I could see how redesigning the space would address their problems. This is what inspired me to dive further into spatial design.</p>
            <p>Communication, empathy and innovation are at the core of my principles with the urge to explore new possibilities by experimentation for growth. I believe the best designs are brought from a profound understanding of users' needs, combined with the relentless pursuit of hard work. I further believe my commitment to quality is driven by collaboration. Insights with diverse perspectives help in making the design innovative by nature. I proceed every project with a sustainable approach, ensuring we give back to Earth as much as we can.</p>
            <p>Additionally, attention to detail from concept development to final production combined with technical knowledge ensures a unique outcome for a complex issue. Ultimately, my goal as a product designer would be to ease daily lives with great plans that are cost-effective utilizing my business acumen, providing the user with the best of both worlds. With personal growth, I’m eager to contribute to projects that prove that design can be limitless.</p>

                    <h3>Mycoll – Bushfire Wildlife Protection</h3>
                    <p>A combination of high temperatures, low humidity, and no rainfall makes Australia prone to bushfires every year during a specific period. With the spread of bushfires, wildlife is deeply impacted along with nature. The challenge here was to come up with a strategy to protect one species of the affected wildlife using self-grown mycelium as a water & fire-resistant material in the event of protection pre-bushfires or post-bushfires.</p>
                    <p>I chose to focus on the Iron Range Forest in Queensland, home to my chosen species Dunnarts. Dunnarts are nocturnal mouse-sized marsupials who live in small burrow-like spaces, and a single bushfire wave can wipe out an entire population.</p>
                    <p>After design thinking, research, fabrication techniques, and trialling out multiple methods, I came up with ‘Mycoll’—a combination of recyclable materials, leaves, and mycelium culture. Volunteers could use small crochet pieces of wool, straw, yarn, paper, or a pile of leaves as a substrate to grow mycelium on. This would then be dropped in certain sections of the forest to work as a fire-resistant cover for dunnarts in case of bushfires.</p>
                    <p>This project was pivotal as it allowed me to address a significant challenge while thinking about nature, sustainability, and expanding my knowledge and reach. It was complex, one of a kind, and required collaboration with other designers as well as the mass public. The pressure to meet deadlines, focus on finer details, and come up with an innovative yet easy solution pushed my limits, highlighting my ability to deliver impactful solutions through constant trialling and improvising. I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project in a way that aligns with my future goals, reinforcing my choice to pursue design as a career.</p>
