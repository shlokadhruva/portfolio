                <h4>The Challenge:</h4>
                <p>A combination of high temperatures, low humidity, and no rainfall makes Australia prone to bushfires every year during a specific period. With the spread of bushfires, wildlife is deeply impacted along with nature. The challenge here for myself was to come up with a strategy to protect one species of the affected wildlife using self-grown mycelium as a water & fire-resistant material in the event of protection pre bushfires or post bushfires.</p>

                <h4>The Research:</h4>
                <p>I chose to focus on the Iron Range Forest in Queensland, which is home to my chosen species Dunnarts. Dunnarts are nocturnal mouse-sized marsupials who live in small burrow-like spaces & a single bushfire wave can wipe out an entire population.</p>

                <h4>The Solution:</h4>
                <p>After design thinking, research, fabrication techniques & trialing out multiple methods, I came up with ‘Mycoll’—a combination of recyclable materials, leaves, and mycelium culture. I would use small crochet pieces of wool, straw, yarn, paper, or a pile of leaves (with the contribution of public volunteers) and use that as a substrate to grow mycelium on. This would then be used by volunteers to drop it in certain sections of the forest and would work as a fire-resistant cover for dunnarts over their territories in case of bushfires.</p>

                <h4>The Takeaways:</h4>
                <p>This project was pivotal for me as it allowed me to address a significant challenge while thinking about nature, sustainability, and expanding my knowledge and reach. This project was complex, one of a kind, and required collaboration with other designers as well as the mass public. With the pressure to meet a deadline, focus on the finer details, and come up with an innovative yet easy solution, this project pushed my limits, highlighting my ability to deliver impactful solutions through constant trialing and improvising. I enjoyed working on this project thoroughly in a way that aligns with my future goals, reinforcing my choice to choose design as a career.</p>
